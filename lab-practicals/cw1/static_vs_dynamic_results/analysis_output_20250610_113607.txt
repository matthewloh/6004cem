MEMORY ACCESS PATTERN ANALYSIS
================================================================
Vector Addition Memory Access Characteristics:
- Sequential memory access pattern
- High spatial locality (adjacent elements)
- Read-heavy workload (2 reads, 1 write per operation)
- Memory bandwidth bound for large vectors
- Cache-friendly for smaller vectors

Impact on Scheduling:
STATIC Scheduling:
  ✓ Excellent cache locality (contiguous chunks)
  ✓ Predictable memory access patterns
  ✓ No synchronization overhead
  ✗ Cannot adapt to memory bandwidth variations

DYNAMIC Scheduling:
  ✓ Can adapt to memory contention
  ✓ Better load balancing under varying system load
  ✗ Potential cache locality issues
  ✗ Synchronization overhead for work assignment
  ✗ Less predictable memory access patterns

================================================================
ANALYSIS: WHY DYNAMIC SCHEDULING MIGHT BE FASTER
================================================================
Potential reasons why Dynamic scheduling outperforms Static:

1. SYSTEM LOAD ADAPTATION:
   - Other processes may be using CPU cores
   - Dynamic scheduling adapts to varying thread performance
   - Static scheduling assumes uniform thread capabilities

2. MEMORY SUBSYSTEM BEHAVIOR:
   - Memory bandwidth contention between cores
   - NUMA effects on multi-socket systems
   - Dynamic scheduling may reduce memory hotspots

3. CACHE EFFECTS:
   - Smaller chunks in dynamic scheduling may fit better in cache
   - Reduced cache pollution from large static chunks
   - Better cache utilization with smaller working sets

4. THREAD SCHEDULING:
   - OS thread scheduler interactions
   - Context switching overhead differences
   - Dynamic work distribution reduces idle time

5. COMPILER OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Different optimization paths for static vs dynamic
   - Loop unrolling and vectorization differences
   - Memory prefetching behavior variations

6. VECTOR SIZE EFFECTS:
   - Smaller vectors benefit from dynamic's adaptability
   - Overhead amortization differs between scheduling types
   - Work granularity impacts on performance

================================================================
